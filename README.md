## Hi there! üëã <br> I'm Ruben, Welcome to my profile 
<!--
### About me
<br>
I am a junior backend developer with a great curiosity and passion for finding logic in things and solving problems. I am always looking to acquire new knowledge and improve my skills. I have professional experience in developing and maintaining applications with Node.js/NestJS, working with technologies such as Typescript, MongoDB, and TypeOrm.

I am interested in learning more about pattern desings, refactoring and I would also love to learn more about frontend development to get a more comprehensive understanding of the whole picture and to become a full stack developer. I am highly motivated to continue growing professionally as a programmer and I enjoy collaborating in a team. Additionally, I am fluent in English thanks to my experience living and working in several English-speaking countries.

In my free time, I enjoy combining outdoor sports with training in various areas of programming, whether to acquire new knowledge or to strengthen my foundations.
